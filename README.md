# Spell Thief — Foundry VTT Module

> *A weaver of stolen magic, a parasite in the arcane ecosystem.*

A homebrew D&D 5e (2024) class for Foundry VTT. Spell Thieves do not only study magic — they **steal it**. They siphon spells mid-cast, hijack curses meant for allies, and redirect devastating effects back at their enemies. Reactive, tactical, and dangerous to spellcasters, a Spell Thief turns arcane power into a liability.
