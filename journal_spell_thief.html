<h1>Spell Thief</h1>
<p><em>A weaver of stolen magic, a parasite in the arcane ecosystem.</em></p>
<p>Spell Thieves do not only study magic — they <strong>steal it</strong>. They siphon spells mid-cast, hijack curses meant for allies, and redirect devastating effects back at their enemies. Reactive, tactical, and dangerous to spellcasters, a Spell Thief turns arcane power into a liability.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Learning Spells</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stolen Spells:</strong> When you successfully steal a spell using Arcane Pickpocket, you can attempt to learn it. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC = 10 + spell level). On a success, you transcribe the spell into your spellbook over the next 8 hours per spell level (minimum 8 hours), costing 100 gp per spell level. Only spells on the wizard spell list can be transcribed this way.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Core Features</h2>

<h3>Arcane Pickpocket</h3>
<p><em>1st-level Spell Thief feature</em></p>
<p>When a creature you can see within 60 feet <strong>casts a spell</strong>, you may use your <strong>reaction</strong> and expend 1 Larceny Die to attempt to steal it.</p>
<p>Make an <strong>Intelligence (Arcana) check</strong>. DC = Enemy Spell DC + the spell's level (minimum 1).</p>
<blockquote><p>You can attempt to steal any spell, but you have disadvantage on checks to steal spells of a level higher than half your Spell Thief level (rounded up).</p></blockquote>
<h4>On a Success</h4>
<p><strong>Flip a coin.</strong> Before the coin lands, ask the GM to call heads or tails.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the GM calls it correctly: the original spell fails and has no effect, though the caster's spell slot is still expended.</li>
  <li>If the GM calls it incorrectly: the original spell still occurs, but you have successfully copied it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell is <strong>stored in your mind</strong> until the end of your next turn (only one spell can be stored at a time). You may cast it using your action, bonus action (if applicable), or reaction <strong>without expending a spell slot</strong>, using your own spell save DC and spell attack modifier.</p>
<p><strong>On a Critical Theft (Natural 20):</strong> You can slightly modify the stolen spell (GM approval).</p>
<h4>On a Failure</h4>
<p>Roll the Larceny Die and reduce any damage you take from that spell by the amount rolled. You cannot steal the spell.</p>
<p><strong>On a Critical Mishap (Natural 1):</strong> The DM chooses one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The spell is cast on you in addition to the original target</li>

<p>When you or a creature within 60 feet takes damage from a spell you can see, you may use your <strong>reaction</strong> and expend 1 Larceny Die to redirect the magical energy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Roll the Larceny Die and add your Intelligence modifier</li>
  <li>Reduce the damage by that amount</li>
  <li>You may redirect the reduced damage to a different creature you can see within 60 feet of the original target</li>
  <li>The redirected damage is the same type as the original spell</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h1>Larcenous Disciplines</h1>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a discipline that defines your approach to magical theft. Your choice grants features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

<h2>Arcane Reaver</h2>
<p><em>A frontline anti-mage who punishes spellcasters with blade and stolen sorcery.</em></p>

<h3>Spellblade Strike</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Arcane Reaver feature</em></p>
<p>When you successfully steal a spell, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack as part of the same reaction, dealing an additional <strong>1d6 force damage</strong>. This increases to 2d6 at 10th level and 3d6 at 14th level.</p>

<h3>Arcane Reflex</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Arcane Reaver feature</em></p>
<p>You gain <strong>one additional reaction</strong> per round usable only for Arcane Pickpocket or Redirect Magic. Additionally, when an attacker you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>

<h3>Antimagic Strikes</h3>
<p><em>6th-level Arcane Reaver feature</em></p>
<p>When you <strong>hit</strong> a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can roll a Larceny Die to add its value as damage and force the target to make a <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong> against your spell save DC. On a failed save, choose one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The creature loses concentration on one spell</li>
  <li>The creature has disadvantage on its next spell attack roll</li>
  <li>The creature's spell save DC is reduced by your Intelligence modifier until the end of your next turn</li>
</ul>
<p>You can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of your attacks.</p>

<h3>Combat Theft</h3>
<p><em>10th-level Arcane Reaver feature</em></p>
<p>When you use Extra Attack, you can replace one attack with an <strong>Arcane Pickpocket</strong> attempt (without using your reaction). You can now use Spellblade Strike and Antimagic Strikes with <strong>small ranged or throwable weapons</strong>. Additionally, when a creature within 40 feet casts a spell, you can make an opportunity attack against them.</p>

<h3>Counterspelling Flurry</h3>
<p><em>14th-level Arcane Reaver feature</em></p>
<p>You can now use Spellblade Strike and Antimagic Strikes with <strong>all weapons</strong> and gain a second extra attack. When you steal a spell, until the end of your next turn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your movement speed increases by 15 feet</li>
  <li>You have advantage on weapon attack rolls</li>
  <li>Your spells gain an additional 20 feet of range</li>
  <li>You can re-roll the steal spell coin flip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hex Broker</h2>
<p><em>A master manipulator of curses, hexes, and debilitating conditions.</em></p>

<h3>Curse Collector</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Hex Broker feature</em></p>
<p>You gain the <strong>Status Transposition</strong> option from Focus Specialization (you do not choose a Focus Specialization at 7th level). When you steal a debuff or harmful magical condition, you gain <strong>temporary hit points</strong> equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>You learn the <em>hex</em> spell. It doesn't count against your spells known, and you can cast it once without expending a spell slot (regained on a short or long rest). You can learn stolen spells from the <strong>warlock spell list</strong>.</p>

<h3>Hex Weaving</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Hex Broker feature</em></p>
<p>When you use Status Transposition to transfer a harmful condition, you can spend an additional Larceny Die to transfer it to <strong>two creatures</strong> instead of one. Both targets make saving throws as normal.</p>

<h3>Invert Fortune</h3>
<p><em>6th-level Hex Broker feature</em></p>
<p>When you steal a beneficial magical effect (such as <em>bless</em>, <em>haste</em>, or <em>invisibility</em>), you can invert it into its negative counterpart when transferring it (e.g., <em>bless</em> → <em>bane</em>, <em>haste</em> → <em>slow</em>, <em>invisibility</em> → <em>faerie fire</em>). The inverted effect uses your spell save DC and lasts for the same duration as the original spell.</p>

<h3>Condition Stacking</h3>
<p><em>10th-level Hex Broker feature</em></p>
<p>When you transfer a magical condition to a creature already suffering from a different magical condition, both effects are enhanced:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Saving throws against both conditions: disadvantage for enemies, advantage for allies</li>
  <li>Damage from both effects increased by 1d6</li>
  <li>Duration of both effects extended by 1 round</li>
</ul>
<p>You can maintain this enhancement on a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>

<h3>Plague Broker</h3>
<p><em>14th-level Hex Broker feature</em></p>
<p>As an action, expend 1 Larceny Die to create a <strong>20-foot-radius sphere</strong> of contagious magic centered on a point within 60 feet. All creatures must make an <strong>Intelligence saving throw</strong> against your spell save DC. On a failed save, each creature shares the magical conditions currently affecting any creature you can see. Allies gain beneficial conditions; enemies share harmful effects. Each lasts for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<h2>Mirror Savant</h2>
<p><em>A trickster who reflects, duplicates, and misdirects magical energy.</em></p>

<h3>Reflective Theft</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Mirror Savant feature</em></p>
<p>When you successfully steal a targeted spell (one that targets specific creatures), you can immediately redirect it to a different valid target within the spell's range. The new target must make the original saving throw or be subjected to the spell attack roll, using your spell save DC or spell attack modifier.</p>

<h3>Illusory Decoy</h3>
<p><em>3rd-level Mirror Savant feature</em></p>
<p>When you steal a spell, you leave behind a magical duplicate of yourself (as per <em>mirror image</em>) that lasts until the start of your next turn. The duplicate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Appears in your space and moves with you, mimicking your actions</li>
  <li>Is indistinguishable from you until destroyed</li>
  <li>Causes attackers to roll a d20 to determine whether the attack targets the duplicate instead (as per <em>mirror image</em>)</li>
  <li>Has AC equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier; destroyed if hit</li>
  <li>Grants advantage on your next Stealth check while it exists</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spell Echo</h3>
<p><em>6th-level Mirror Savant feature</em></p>
<p>When you cast a stolen spell, you can expend a Larceny Die to create a weaker echo. Roll the Larceny Die: on a 5 or higher, you can cast the spell again immediately at a different target at base spell level, using your spell save DC and attack modifier. You can't create an echo of an echo.</p>

<h3>Swap Fate</h3>
<p><em>10th-level Mirror Savant feature</em></p>
<p>When a spell targets you or an ally within 30 feet, you can use your reaction and expend a Larceny Die to swap positions with that creature. The spell now targets you instead, and:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You appear in the ally's space; the ally appears in yours</li>
  <li>You can immediately attempt to steal the spell using Arcane Pickpocket as part of the same reaction</li>
  <li>The swapped ally gains the benefits of your Illusory Decoy feature (a duplicate lasts until the start of your next turn)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mirror Cascade</h3>
<p><em>14th-level Mirror Savant feature</em></p>
<p>Once per long rest, when you steal a spell of 5th level or lower, you can create <strong>four echoes</strong> of that spell instead of one. Each echo can target a different creature or area within the spell's range. The echoes all resolve simultaneously, use your spell save DC and spell attack modifier, and are cast at base spell level.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Multiclassing</h2>
<p><strong>Minimum Ability Scores:</strong> Intelligence 13, Dexterity 13</p>
<p><strong>Proficiencies Gained:</strong> Light armor, simple weapons, thieves' tools</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>The Spell Thief is designed as a <strong>reactive half-caster</strong> comparable to Paladins and Rangers in power level.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> With 2–6 Larceny Dice and half-caster spell slots, Spell Thieves must choose their moments carefully.</li>
  <li><strong>Reactive Nature:</strong> Many features require reactions, meaning Spell Thieves sacrifice opportunity attacks and some defensive options.</li>
  <li><strong>Scaling DCs:</strong> As enemies cast higher-level spells, Arcane Pickpocket becomes harder without Improved Arcane Larceny's advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Martial Parity:</strong> Extra Attack, Fighting Style, and medium armor keep Spell Thieves competitive when magic isn't being thrown around.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DM Guidance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spell Identification:</strong> Allow Intelligence (Arcana) checks as a free action, or simply inform the player what spell is being cast.</li>
  <li><strong>Legendary Resistance:</strong> Can be used to prevent spell theft, as with any other effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Reaction Timing:</strong> Arcane Pickpocket must be declared when the spell is cast, before effects resolve.</li>
  <li><strong>Concentration Limits:</strong> Spell Thieves can only concentrate on one spell at a time until 20th level.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiclass Interactions:</strong> A Spell Thief multiclassed with a full caster can become very powerful — monitor carefully.</li>
</ul>
